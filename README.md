# Vulnerability-and-exploit-collector-and-map-for-information-security-analytics
This set of tools allows you to implement an analytical mapping mechanism applicable to software vulnerabilities. 
It contains:
1. Collectors of publications about software vulnerabilities and exploits;
2. A dump of the finished database for 2020-2022;
3. Graph-landscape created by the force method of stacking graphs;
4. A ready-made version of the software vulnerability map and a lot of useful accompanying documentation and files;

# dbDumps
This section presents a dump of the database of vulnerabilities and exploits of the software. 
Information was collected from publications nvd.nist.gov and exploit-db.com in the period 2020-2022. 
To run the database from the presented image, you need to use the Neo4j DBMS.

Database Schema:

# Scripts 
The presented section contains scripts for assembling information from the resources described above:
1. exploit-db.com.py; 
2. nvd.gist.gov.py;  
and a script for creating a map landscape:
gephi_map.py

# Gephi
This section presents a graph created on the basis of information unloaded from the database,
which has many links within itself of the type: CWE-CPE-PRODUCT. By means of force stacking algorithms in the Gephi software,
we obtain the source file for creating the landscape and processing it with the script from the previous section

# Map/map_cve
This section presents an information and analytical map of software vulnerabilities. 
it has layers: 
1. Habitats for vulnerabilities; 
2. Clusters with vulnerability risk assessment based on frequency analysis and CVSS assessment; 
3. Vulnerable products; 
4. Types of CWE errors; 
5. CVE vector; 
6. Layer with links to the source code of vulnerabilities
The map was created using the QGIS 3.x software

# Documents
The section of documents contains intermediate 
1. Files for frequency assessment of vulnerabilities; 
2. Requests to the database for unloading certain data; 
3. An image describing a transient 3D frequency vulnerability hazard analysis as a probabilistic risk characteristic. 
4. Assessed risks by clusters for 2020-2022; 
5. DB scheme; 
6. A diagram of the entire analytical mapping module presented in this repository
